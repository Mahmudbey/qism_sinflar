Maybe my soulmate died, I don't know
All of this miscommunication, indecisiveness, be patient

You're a woman, I'm a man.


You're a woman, I'm a man.
You're my fortune, I'm your fame.
These are things we can't disguise.
Be my lady of the night.

High heels, no clouds
Sun kissed in cloud
Can't stop, slow down
I want you, I want you
No call, no rain
One kiss, no pain
Tell me again
I want you, I want you
You don't wanna talk, then you wanna talk
Then you wanna tell me I'm not and to move along
Then you wander back in my heart like a bitter song
And we're never done 'cause I need your love, I need your love
California, Hallelujah
You and me are gonna live for today girl
I'm the luckiest man in the whole world
Stole my heart but can't afford ya
All I know is I'm with you today girl
I'm the luckiest man in the whole world
Lies you don't keep
Hurt and I'll bleed
But you're so sweet
And I want you, I want you, yeah
You don't wanna talk, then you wanna talk
Then you wanna tell me I'm not and to move along
Then you wander back in my heart like a bitter song
And we're never done cause I need your love, I need your love
You don't wanna talk, then you wanna talk
Then you wanna tell me I'm not and to move along
Then you wander back in my heart like a bitter song
And we're never done cause I need your love, I need your love, yeah
California, Hallelujah
You and me are gonna live for today girl
I'm the luckiest man in the whole world
Stole my heart but can't afford ya
All I know is I'm with you today girl
I'm the luckiest man in the whole world
C'mon, c'mon, I see it in your eyes
C'mon, c'mon, just love me for one night
C'mon, c'mon, I see it in your eyes
C'mon, c'mon, just love me for one night
California, Hallelujah
You and me are gonna live for today girl
I'm the luckiest man in the whole world
Stole my heart but can't afford ya
All I know is I'm with you today girl
I'm the luckiest man in the whole world
California, Hallelujah
Then you wander back in my heart like a bitter song
And we're never done cause I need your love, I need your love
Stole my heart but can't afford ya
Then you wander back in my heart like a bitter song
And we're never done cause I need your love, I need your love
